Discord bot meant to get perfomance point information for Osu! maps by using [oppai](https://osu.lesel.es/).

WIP, potentially something larger in the future?

## Dependencies
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
* [JDA with dependencies](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA)
* [oppai](https://github.com/Francesco149/oppai/releases)

----

## Installation and usage
* To build from source, you need to install maven and get all dependencies of the program.
* Run `mvn clean compile assembly:single` on the command line to build an executable jar file.
* To use with your own discord bot, put your bot api key in `Keys/botapi.key`, and put your Discord user ID in `Keys/owneruser.key`
